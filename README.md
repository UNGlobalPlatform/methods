# UN Global Working Group - Big Data 
The UN Global Working Group on Big Data was created in 2014 for Official Statistics and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to explore the potential of new technologies and data sources. As part of the Working Group, we are developing the UN Global Platform for Data, Services and Applications. The aim of the platform is to provide a marketplace and infrastructure that UN member countries can access and use in their exploitation of big data.

As part of the UN Global Platform, we are prototyping a number of services for data scientists, developers and statisticians. These services are aimed primarily at government / public sector members, and their academia and private sector partners. If you are working on new data science applications or exciting data sources that can benefit the global community, do get in touch. These are not limited to what the statistical community has traditionally explored, but include, for example:
- satellite imagery and indicators of pollution, water coverage, etc.
- transport statistics using internet-of-things (IoT) 
- private / public data partnerships on data sources such as social media, retail, employment

# methods.officialstatistics.org
We are partnering with Algorithmia to provide a methods & algorithms service. The aim of this service is for data scientists and statisticians around the world to be able to publish their statistical methods, algorithms and data science models, so that they can be reused at a global scale. 

The service allows you to:
- write methods / algorithms (pretty much anything that you can turn into a callable function) using your own IDE or the one provided by us
- execute methods / algorithms remotely - all the algorithms are published as APIs and can be called using your credentials from anywhere
- publish methods / algorithms - you can publish algorithms with their documentation, versioning, etc. - Algorithmia does do the versioning, dependency management, compilation, scaling and API deployment for you
- share and document - you can document the algorithms on-site, as well as discuss them and share them

# looking for testers
You can explore the site at

and if you are a government (any UN government) data scientist / statistician, do ask for a user account at methods@officialstatistics.org
